# Tumor Classification

This repository contains a project for classifying tumors using machine learning techniques. The project leverages Python for backend computations and HTML for presenting results or creating a user interface.

---

## Features

- **Tumor Classification**: Predict tumor types using trained machine learning models.
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Present results and insights in an intuitive and user-friendly HTML interface.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Designed to handle various datasets for tumor classification.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/OA2in/Tumor-Classification.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Tumor-Classification
   ```
3. Install the necessary dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

---

## Usage

1. Prepare your dataset and place it in the `data/` directory.
2. Run the Python script for model training or prediction:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
3. If applicable, open the HTML interface to view the results:
   ```bash
   open templates/index.html
   ```
